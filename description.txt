this is the solution on windows 11

1. check your PATH in enviroment variables, 
    
    if yes, go find the corresponding folder according to the PATH and see 2.
    
    if no, add the path of VScode folder in your PATH in enviroment variables(normally installed in C:)

2. check if there exists "code.cmd" in the folder.(code.cmd is a command file, will execute right after you click on)

    if yes, click on to reactivate it and you should be able to use 'code .'

    if no, open VScode and click ctrl + shift + p, then type in this  “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH.”

3. after above steps, the 'code .' command in your terminal should work out successfully
